# 🎮 Carmen's Jeopardy Quiz Game

This project combines Python data analysis with a custom-built trivia game based on themes like **Bob’s Burgers** and **Zodiac Signs**.

It was created as part of the *Data Science: Pandas module* from Codecademy and expanded with personal creativity, terminal interaction, and replayable quiz functionality.
